# base-fs-conflicts [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/base-fs-conflicts.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/base-fs-conflicts) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/base-fs-conflicts.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/base-fs-conflicts) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/node-base/base-fs-conflicts.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/node-base/base-fs-conflicts)

Detect potential file system conflicts and if necessary prompt the user before overwriting files.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save base-fs-conflicts
```

## Attribution

Some of the logic in this plugin, in particular [lib/diffs.js](./lib/diffs.js), is based on the conflicter code in [yeoman-generator](http://yeoman.io), Copyright (c) 2015, Google, licensed under [BSD-2-Clause](http://yeoman.io/learning/faq.html#license).

## Usage

The following code should work with any [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) application, including [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb), [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble), and [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate).

```js
var path = require('path');
var Base = require('base');
var fs = require('base-fs');
var conflicts = require('base-fs-conflicts');
var base = new Base();

// register the `conflicts` and `fs` plugins
base.use(conflicts());
base.use(fs());

// pass the same `dest` to both `.dest()` and `.conflicts()`
var dest = 'fixtures/dist';

base.src('fixtures/*.txt')
  .pipe(base.conflicts(dest)) // adds a `.conflicts()` method
  .pipe(base.dest(dest));
```

**Example**

If a file conflict is detected, you'll see something like this in the terminal:

<img width="570" alt="screen shot 2016-03-17 at 8 05 53 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/383994/13864890/d9f67420-ec7b-11e5-973d-47462989d773.png">

## API

1. The existing file's contents is compared with `file.contents` on the vinyl file
2. If the contents of both are identical, no action is taken
3. If the contents differ, the user is prompted for action
4. If no conflicting file exists, the vinyl file is written to the file system

**Params**

* `dest` **{String}**: The same desination directory passed to `app.dest()`
* `returns` **{String}**

**Example**

```js
app.src('foo/*.js')
  .pipe(app.conflicts('foo'))
  .pipe(app.dest('foo'));
```
